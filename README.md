# Clap-Switch

The Clap Switch is an engaging hobby circuit that turns on lights with a clap sound. Despite its name, the switch can be activated by any sound of a similar pitch. The core component of this circuit is the Electric Condenser Mic, which functions as a sound sensor. The mic converts sound energy into electrical energy, which then triggers a 555 timer IC through a transistor. The 555 IC activation turns on an LED, which automatically turns off after a set period.
This simple circuit employs minimal components to achieve functionality. More complex versions of clap switches with additional components can perform similar tasks, but simplicity often requires more effort than complexity.
